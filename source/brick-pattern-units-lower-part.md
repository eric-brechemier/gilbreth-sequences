## COMMENTS

(same as Upper Part except last paragraph below)

This sequence, Lower Part of Frank and Lillian Gilbreth Brick Pattern Units,
describes courses of bricks in the bottom half of the units, from bottom to
middle course excluded.

The n-th term of the sequence, starting at offset 2, describes the course just
below the middle course in Unit #n, which is a reversed copy of the middle
course in Unit #n-1.

The first n terms of this sequence describe the courses of bricks in the
lower part of Unit #n, from bottom to middle course excluded.

Unit #1 contains only a single course, which is its middle course. The lower
part of units does not include the middle course. This is why the offset in
this sequence starts at 2, which is the first unit with a lower part.

The top half of the units, from bottom to middle course included, is described
in the associated sequence:

  Upper Part of Frank and Lillian Gilbreth Brick Pattern Units.
